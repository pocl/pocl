  /**
   * Main function of the client I/O thread. Polls client sockets for new
   * connections and open connections for new requests. Pushes requests to their
   * respective context once they are fully read.
   *
   * The main loop within this function consists of 3 phases: the poll(), the
   * reads and the reaping of closed fds.
   *
   * First, a vector of pollfd descriptors is constructed for all open sockets.
   * This vector is cached across iterations and rebuilt from scratch whenever
   * the list of open fds changes. Once the list is constructed (if needed),
   * poll(2) is invoked, putting the thread to sleep until something happens.
   *
   * Once poll returns, two things happen: if there are new connection requests
   * on the client listener sockets, they are accepted. Once both fds of the
   * (command, stream) pairs have been obtained, the client handshake is
   * performed and the fds are associated with a new or existing client context
   * based on the handshake.
   *
   * After the special case of the listener sockets, if there are further events
   * in the poll result, the respective fds are handed to Result::read for
   * reading a piece of the next command sent over that socket. Similar to the
   * pollfd list, the function keeps a list of in-flight Requests for this
   * purpose. If there are any read errors or poll results indicating that a
   * socket was closed, the corresponding fd is pushed into a list for cleanup.
   *
   * Finally, the function goes over the "dead" fds list, closes them and
   * removes the fd and its in-flight Request.
