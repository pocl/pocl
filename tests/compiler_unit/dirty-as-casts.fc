# At least the HIP/CUDA frontend since LLVM 19 seems to produce AS casts
# through ptrtoint - inttoptr conversion chains. It confuses the alias
# analyzer and leads to lack of utilization of "restrict" pointer information.
# It should be fixed upstream, but before that happens, we just peephole
# optimize this case.
#
# The SPV input is the adam-hip case of HeCbench compiled via chipStar 1.2.1
# with LLVM 19.
