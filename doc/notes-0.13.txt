Portable Computing Language (pocl) v0.13 released
-------------------------------------------------

March 2016

Pocl's goal is to become a performance portable open source (MIT-licensed)
implementation of the OpenCL standard.

In addition to producing an easily portable open-source OpenCL
implementation, another major goal of this project is improving
performance portability of OpenCL programs with compiler
optimizations, reducing the need for target-dependent manual
optimizations.

Release highlights:

Highlights
-----------
* Support for LLVM/Clang 3.8 and 3.7, all older are unsupported
* initial (partial) OpenCL 2.0 support
* CMake build system almost on parity with autotools

We consider pocl ready for wider scale testing, although the OpenCL
standard is not yet fully implemented, and it contains known bugs.
The pocl test suite compiles and runs most of the ViennaCL 1.5.1
examples, Rodinia 2.0.1 benchmarks, Parboil benchmarks, OpenCL
Programming Guide book samples, VexCL test cases, Luxmark v2.0,
most of the AMD APP SDK v2.9 OpenCL samples and piglit OpenCL tests
among others.
