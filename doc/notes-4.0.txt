Portable Computing Language (PoCL) v4.0 released
------------------------------------------------

PoCL is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the
OpenCL standard. It aims to support the minimal v3.0 feature set (official
conformance stamp not yet applied for).

In addition to being an easily portable multi-device (truly
heterogeneous) open-source OpenCL implementation, a major goal of the
project is improving interoperability for diversity of OpenCL-capable
devices by integrating them to a single centrally orchestrated platform.
Another key goal is to enhance performance portability of OpenCL
programs across device types utilizing runtime and compiler techniques.

Upstream PoCL currently supports various CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs via libcuda,
Vulkan-compatible GPUs (experimental) and ASIPs (experimental,
see: http://openasip.org). It is also known to have multiple (private)
adaptations in active production use.

Release Highlights
------------------

* Support for Clang/LLVM 16.0
* Support for Clang/LLVM 6-9 (inclusive) dropped
* More improvements to SPIR-V support for CPU and CUDA drivers
* CPU drivers: gained support for program-scope variables, generic AS,
  cl_khr_fp16 (LLVM 16+), cl_khr_subgroups, cl_intel_unified_shared_memory.
* New driver for devices using the Level Zero API.

Misc. Notes
-----------

* Please note that there's an official PoCL "maintenance policy" in
place. This text describes the policy and how you can get your favourite
project that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future PoCL
releases: http://portablecl.org/docs/html/maintainer-policy.html

* We are looking for ARM CPU and RISC-V CPU maintainers (and any other
target of your interest). If you are interested in ensuring PoCL stays
stable for these processor architectures in the future, please contact us.

* The dedicated TTASim driver will be deprecated once the AlmaIF driver
reaches feature parity with it.
