Portable Computing Language (PoCL) v1.7 released
------------------------------------------------

PoCL is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the
OpenCL standard (1.2 with some 2.0 and 3.0 features supported).

In addition to being an easily portable multi-device (truely heterogeneous)
open-source OpenCL implementation, a major goal of this project is
improving interoperability for diversity of OpenCL-capable devices by
integrating them to a single centrally orchestrated platform. Another
key goal is to enhance performance portability of OpenCL programs
across device types utilizing runtime and compiler techniques.

Upstream PoCL currently supports various CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs via libcuda,
HSA-supported GPUs and TCE ASIPs (experimental, see: http://openasip.org).
It is also known to have multiple (private) adaptations in active production
use.

Release Highlights
------------------

* Support for Clang/LLVM 12.0
* Improved support for cross-compiling
* Improved support for SPIR-V binaries when using CPU device
* Changed default target OpenCL version to 3.0

Misc. Notes
-----------

* Please note that there's an official PoCL "maintenance policy" in place.
This text describes the policy and how you can get your favourite
project that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future PoCL
releases: http://portablecl.org/docs/html/maintainer-policy.html

* We are still looking for an ARM and RISC-V CPU maintainers. If you
are interested in ensuring a PoCL stays stable for these processor
architectures, please let us know!

Customized Parallel Computing (CPC) research group of Tampere University,
Finland leads the development of PoCL on the side and for the needs of
their research projects. This project has received funding from the ECSEL
Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 783162 (FitOptiVis).
The JU receives support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and
innovation programme and Netherlands, Czech Republic, Finland, Spain, Italy.
It was also supported by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation
programme under Grant Agreement No 871738 (CPSoSaware).

The financial support is very much appreciated -- it keeps the open source
project going!
