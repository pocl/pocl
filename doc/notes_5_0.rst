Release Notes for PoCL 5.0
*****************************

=============================
Major new features
=============================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Remote Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PoCL now has a new backend (called 'remote') for offloading OpenCL commands
across a network to one or more servers that are running the (also newly
added) 'pocld' daemon. See the `announcement <http://portablecl.org/remote-backend.html>`
and the `documentation <http://portablecl.org/docs/html/remote.html>` for more details.

=============================
Bugfixes and minor features
=============================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CUDA driver (partial) OpenCL 3.0 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CUDA driver has gained some new features:

* program scope variables
* OpenCL 2.x/3.x atomics
* initial subgroup support (only intel_sub_group_shuffle, intel_sub_group_shuffle_xor,
  get_sub_group_local_id, sub_group_barrier, sub_group_ballot are supported)
* enable FP16 & generic address space support (with SPIR-V input)


* PoCL currently reports `cl_khr_spir` for SPIR 1.x/2.0 support, but this has
  never been tested properly and will be removed in the next release. SPIR-V
  remains the supported option.
