Basic usage
===========

The basic usage of pocl should be as easy as any other OpenCL implementation.

While it is possible to link against pocl directly, the recommended way is to 
use the ICD interface.

Android applications can use pocl using jni. App has to dlopen
“/data/data/org.pocl.libs/files/lib/libpocl.so” and dlsym OpenCL function
symbols from it.

Linking your program with pocl through an icd loader
----------------------------------------------------

You can link your OpenCL program against an ICD loader. If your ICD loader is
correctly configured to load pocl, your program will be able to use pocl.
See the section below for more information about ICD and  ICD loaders.

Example of compiling an OpenCL host program using the free ocl-icd loader::

   gcc example1.c -o example `pkg-config --libs --cflags OpenCL`

Example of compiling an OpenCL host program using the AMD ICD loader (no
pkg-config support)::

   gcc example1.c -o example -lOpenCL

Installable client driver (ICD)
-------------------------------

pocl is built with the ICD extensions of OpenCL by default. This allows you 
to have several OpenCL implementations concurrently on your computer, and 
select the one to use at runtime by selecting the corresponding cl_platform. 
ICD support can be disabled by adding the flag::

  -DENABLE_ICD=OFF

to the CMake invocation.

The ocl-icd ICD loader allows to use the OCL_ICD_VENDORS environment variable
to specify a (non-standard) replacement for the /etc/OpenCL/vendors directory.

An ICD loader is an OpenCL library acting as a "proxy" to one of the various OpenCL
implementations installed in the system. pocl does not provide an ICD loader itself, 
but NVidia, AMD, Intel, Khronos, and the free ocl-icd project each provides one.

* `Khronos <http://www.khronos.org/opencl/>`_

Linking your program directly with pocl
---------------------------------------

Passing the appropriate linker flags is enough to use pocl in your
program. However, please bear in mind that:

The pkg-config tool is used to locate the libraries and headers in
the installation directory. 

Example of compiling an OpenCL host program against pocl using
the pkg-config::

   gcc example1.c -o example `pkg-config --libs --cflags pocl`

In this link mode, your program will always require the pocl OpenCL library. It
wont be able to run with another OpenCL implementation without recompilation.

Using pocl on Android
---------------------

Since pocl is installed in a non-standard path, dynamic linking is not possible.
App has to dlopen “/data/data/org.pocl.libs/files/lib/libpocl.so” and dlsym
OpenCL function symbols from it.

Refer examples/pocl-android-sample/ for hello-world android app that uses pocl.
This app uses a third-party stub OpenCL library that does dlopen/dlsym on its behalf

Using pocl on MacOSX
--------------------

On MacOSX, you can either link your program directly with pocl or link through an ICD loader.
If you use an ICD loader, Apple OpenCL implementation will be invisible, unless you use a
wrapper library to expose the Apple OpenCL implementation as an ICD.
