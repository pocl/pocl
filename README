This directory tree holds Portable OpenCL (pocl), a (still in-development)
implementation of OpenCL standard which can be easily adapted for new targets.

The file INSTALL in this directory says how to build and install packages
which use the GNU build system, most of which is valid for the pocl
distribution.

This file provides additional information on required software packages,
special configure flags pocl might use, running pocl examples and using
pocl as the OpenCL implementation with any program that uses OpenCL. It
also describes the "standalone compilation mode" which might be used to
statically link kernels with the host program, and how to call any
host C library or syscall in your kernels which might be useful for
kernel debugging (see HOST LIBRARY CALLS).


EXAMPLES

After the build is complete, a number of examples are ready to be run on
the subdirectories under examples/. To run them, just go to each directory
and run the executable there (executable name matches subdirectory name).

    example1      Dot product example from OpenCL specification
    example2      Matrix transpose example from OpenCL specification
    barriers      Simple barrier synchronization exampls
    forloops      Simple example wth for loops inside the kernel

STANDALONE

The "standalone compilation mode" is especially useful for embedded standalone 
platforms which do not include an operating system with a dynamic linker
and still want to run OpenCL programs to exploit the language's parallelism.

The key idea in the standalone mode is to link the OpenCL kernels statically 
to the host program and make the kernels appear in the "kernel registry" of 
the host API so they can be lauched from the main program without needing to
invoke the runtime kernel compilation. 

The original targets of this method are the application-specific TTA processors 
designed with the TTA-Based Co-design Environment (http://tce.cs.tut.fi) which 
now uses pocl for kernel compilation. TCE's compiler driver script tcecc serves 
as an example how to register and launch the kernels seamlessly in the 
compilation/linkage chain of standalone OpenCL programs.

The 'pocl-standalone' script can be used to compile OpenCL C kernels separately
to be linked with the main program in this setting.

HOST LIBRARY CALLS

When using the "native" device that runs the kernels on the host (after
statically replicating their work items), the kernels might use any
library or system call in the host. The examples "barriers" and "forloops"
show how to call "printf" inside the kernel, but any other host function 
can be called as well. This can prove quite useful when debugging OpenCL 
kernels.
