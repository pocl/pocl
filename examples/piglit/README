piglit test suite contains OpenCL tests which are useful to
get working.

I (Pekka JÃ¤Ã¤skelÃ¤inen) have pushed a branch of piglit with some
fixes to issues in piglit found along the way. That branch should
be used to test pocl until all fixes are merged upstream.

So, here's how to run the piglit suite against pocl:

# Get the upstream repo to piglit directory: 
git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/piglit

# reconfigure pocl
./configure

# piglit should appear in enabled testsuite list

# Build the piglit test framework by running make in pocl top source directory
make check TESTSUITEFLAGS="-k piglit"

# Setup ocl-icd to use the build tree pocl
export OCL_ICD_VENDORS=LOCATION_TO_POCL_ROOT/ocl-vendors

# Run the OCL test suite in piglit source directory
./piglit-run.py tests/all_cl.tests results/all

# OR by running
make check TESTSUITEFLAGS="-k piglit"


# Produce a summary HTML page of the results
./piglit-summary-html.py summary/pocl results/all/main

# Now under summary/pocl there should be index.html etc. which
# can be used to browse the test results and logs.


If you do something affecting piglit test results (fix something to make a 
test pass) then you should make new reference file by 
running:
./piglit-run.py tests/all_cl.tests results/all 2>&1 | cut -d ':' -f 5- -s | grep "pass" > ../piglit_ref_output
