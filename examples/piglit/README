piglit test suite contains OpenCL tests which are useful to
get working.

I (Pekka Jääskeläinen) have pushed a branch of piglit with some
fixes to issues in piglit found along the way. That branch should
be used to test pocl until all fixes are merged upstream.

So, here's how to run the piglit suite against pocl:

git clone http://www.cs.tut.fi/~pjaaskel/piglit.git
# to get the upstream repo: git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/piglit

cd piglit
ccmake .
# It should open the cmake's curses GUI. Select only the CL tests and
# deselect waffle.

# Build the piglit test framework
make

# Setup ocl-icd to use the build tree pocl
export OCL_ICD_VENDORS=LOCATION_TO_POCL_ROOT/ocl-vendors

# Run the OCL test suite
./piglit-run.py tests/all_cl.tests results/all

# Produce a summary HTML page of the results
./piglit-summary-html.py summary/pocl results/all/main

# Now under summary/pocl there should be index.html etc. which
# can be used to browse the test results and logs.
