0.8  August 2013
================

This lists only the most interesting changes. Please
refer to the version control log for a full listing.

Overall
-------

- Added support for LLVM/Clang 3.3.
- Dropped support for LLVM/Clang v3.1.
- Removed the depedency on llvm-ld (which was copied to
  pocl-llvm-ld to pocl tree). Now uses llvm-link instead.
- Project renamed to Portable Computing Language (pocl).
- Luxmark v2.0 now works.
- x86_64 can now use efficient math built-in function
  implementations from the vecmathlib project to avoid libm 
  calls and to exploit the SIMD instructions more efficiently
  in case of vector datatypes in the kernel.
- Parallelize kernel inner loops "horizontally", if possible.
  This converts possibly sequential inner kernel loops to parallel 
  loops by effectively performing "loop interchange" of the
  work-item loop and the kernel's inner loop.
- Added VexCL tests to the test suite. All but one of them
  work with pocl.

Major bugfixes
--------------
- Fixed passing NULL as a buffer argument to clSetKernelArg
  (this time with a regression test added).
- Constant BitCast expressions broken to variables to avoid
  crashing when copying a kernel with casts on automatic
  local pointers.
- Fixes for i386/i686. Tested on Pentium4/Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.
- Lots of API error checking added (found by the Piglit testing suite).
- Fixed bug in select producing incorrect results when the third
  conditional argument is an unsigned scalar or vector.
- Replaced deprecated SSE 4.1 assembly mneunomics in x86-64 min/max
  kernel functions that have since been removed in more recent
  versions of gas and llvm-as.
- SPIR/LLVM IR 'byval' attributes are now handled correctly on
  kernel function arguments, allowing for structs and oversized
  vectors to be passed in with value semantics.
- Fixed to work with the latest Khronos OpenCL headers for 1.2.
  Some issues fixed with the new cl.hpp.
- The ICD dispatch table was too small which might have caused
  "interesting" behavior when calling the later functions in
  the table and not using ocl-icd as the dispatcher.
- Several kernel compiler bugs fixed.
- A multithreaded host application could free the same object
  multiple times due to a race issue.

Platform Layer implementations (OpenCL 1.2 Chapter 4)
-----------------------------------------------------
- Return correctly formatted CL_DEVICE_VERSION and
  CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_VERSION.
- clGetDeviceInfo: Use the 'cpufreq' sys interface of Linux for 
  querying the CPU clock frequency, if available.

The OpenCL Runtime (OpenCL 1.2 Chapter 5)
-----------------------------------------
- clGetEventInfo: Querying the command type, command queue,
  and the reference count of the event.

Builtin Function Implementations (OpenCL 1.2 Section 6.12)
----------------------------------------------------------
- convert_type* builtins now generated with a Python script by
  Victor Oliveira.
- length() fingerprint was assuming two arguments instead of one.
- The kernel bitcode library is now optimized when built in pocl. Speeds
  up kernel optimization for cases which use the kernel functions
  a lot.
- Fix mul_hi() implementation

ICD
---
- Fixed pocl tests to work when executed through the Khronos 
  supplied icd loader (needs a patch applied to the loader be able to
  override the .icd search path).

Misc.
-----
- Fix to the helper script search logic:
  Search from the BUILDDIR only if env POCL_BUILDING is defined.
  Otherwise search from PKGDATADIR first, then from the PATH.
- Fixed memory leaks in clCreateContext* and clCreateKernel
- Ensured that stored arguments are adequately aligned in
  clSetKernelArg and clEnqueueNDRangeKernel.

0.7  January 2013
=================

This lists only the most interesting changes. Please
refer to the version control log for a full listing.

Overall
-------
- Support for LLVM 3.2.
- Multi-WI work group functions can be now generated
  using loops which are only partially unrolled. Reduces
  code size explosion with large WGs in comparison to
  the full replication method.
- PowerPC 64 support (tested on Cell/Debian Sid/PS3).
- PowerPC 32 support (tested on Cell/Debian Sid/PS3).
- ARM v7 support (on Linux)
- Beginning of Cell SPU support (very experimental!).
- Most of the AMD APP SDK OpenCL examples now work and have been
  added to the pocl test suite.
- Most of the Parboil benchmark cases added to the test
  suite.

Kernel Compiler Passes
----------------------
- Several miscompilations and compiler crashes fixed.
- Multiple bugs fixed from the work group vectorizer.
- Updated metadata format pocl uses to pass information
  to vectorization and TCE backend to simplify debuging.
- Kernel pointer arguments are not always marked 'noalias' (restricted).
  Doing this previously was a specs misunderstanding.
- ConstantGEPs to static variables generated from automated
  locals caused problems. Now converting them to normal GEPs
  using a pass from the SAFECode project.

OpenCL Platform Layer implementations (OpenCL 1.2 Chapter 4)
-------------------------------------------------------
- clGetDeviceInfo now uses the hwloc lib for device property
  queries. Many new queries implemented.
- clGetKernelInfo (initial implementation)
- clGetMemObjectInfo (initial implementation)
- clGetCommandQueueInfo (initial implementation)
- clReleaseDevice
- clRetainDevice
- Proper freeing of devices in clReleaseContext

The OpenCL Runtime Implementations (OpenCL 1.2 Chapter 5)
---------------------------------------------------------
- clBuildProgram: support for passing options to the compiler.
- clEnqueueMarker

OpenCL C Builtin Function Implementations (OpenCL 1.2 Section 6.12)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Atomic Functions (6.12.11)
- get_global_offset() was not linked correctly

Framework
---------

- Made it possible to override the .cl -> .bc build command
  called by clBuildProgram per device.

Device Drivers
--------------

- pthread/basic:
  * extract CPU clock frequency from /proc/cpuinfo, if available
  * return cl_khr_fp64 if doubles supported by the CPU
- ttasim: support for explicitly calling custom/special operations
  through the vendor extensions API

Misc.
-----

- Fixes for MacOSX builds.
- Fixed passing NULL as a buffer argument to clSetKernelArguments
- Fixed a major bug when launching the same kernel multiple times:
  the arguments very not copied to the command object.
- Fixed several issues with ICD, it is now considered stable to be
  used by default.

0.6   August 2012
=================

Kernel library
--------------

- Added initial optimized kernel library for X86_64/SSE.
- Preliminary support for ARM architectures on Linux
  (briefly tested on MeeGo/Nokia N9).

Pthread device driver
---------------------

- Multithreading at the work group granularity using pthreads.
- Tries to figure out the optimal maximum number of
  threads for the system based on the available hardware
  threads. Currently works only in Linux using the
  /proc/cpuinfo interface.
- Region-based customized memory allocator for speeding up buffer
  allocations.

Kernel compiler
---------------

- Most of the tricky work group barrier cases (barriers inside
  for-loops etc) now supported.
- Support for local variables, also automatic locals.
- Reuse previous compilation results, if available.
- Automatic vectorization of work groups (multiple work items
  in parallel).

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Installable Client Driver (icd) support.
- Event profiling support (incomplete, works only for kernel and
  buffer read/write/map/unmap events).

Known issues
------------

- Non-pointer struct kernel arguments fail due to varying ABIs
  * https://bugs.launchpad.net/pocl/+bug/987905
- Produces always "fully unrolled" chains of work items for
  work groups causing code size explosion for large WGs.
