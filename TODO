Version roadmap
---------------

High priority:
    * make NVIDIA OpenCL SDK examples to work (1.0)
    * make Intel OpenCL SDK examples to work (1.0)    
    * make the book examples at 
      https://code.google.com/p/opencl-book-samples
      to work (1.0)   

Medium priority:
    * complete the kernel runtime library.   
    * complete the host runtime library.
    * device supporting AMD GPU cards.
    * Check all the function pointers in the ICD dispatch struct.

Low priority:
    * gdb target (generates code for any llvm-compatible target and launches.
      workgroups on gdb simulator).
    * device supporting IBM Cell BE.

(1.0) == requirement for the pocl 1.0 release

Known missing OpenCL 1.2 features
---------------------------------

Missing APIs used by the tested OpenCL example suites are
entered here. This is not a complete list of unimplemented
APIs in pocl, but one that has been updated whenever 
missing APIs have been encountered in the test cases.

(*) == Used by the opencl-book-samples. 
(R) == Used by the Rodinia benchmark suite.
(P) == Used by pyopencl
(B) == Used by the Parboil benchmarks

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/pocl/+bug/987905

Other
-----
* configure should check for 'clang'
* build system should use $(CXX) everywhere,
  now some parts assume g++ and it fails if 
  only c++ is installed
* use the loop vectorizer capabilities of 
  LLVM 3.2+ by ensuring the wiloop structures are 
  vectorizable
* use SPIR as the Clang target to unify ABI etc.
  to fix the structs-as-values etc. Then a target-specific
  IR emission phase should exploit target-specific 
  optimizations (SPIR->POCL KERNEL COMPILER->LLVM IR->ASM?)
* clear the target/device/host hassle: 

pthread and basic device drivers always use the same CPU as 
the host. 

Rest of the devices (most likely) require an explicit target 
anyways (e.g. tce, spu, ...). They use a separately built
kernel library, but for pthread/dthread the default built
could be used. 

Per-target overriding of kernel builtin functions should be still 
kept intact to enable use of target-specif inline assembly and 
intrinsics for wanted builtin functions. 

If the default kernel library is built we can exploit llc's 
automatic CPU feature detection and tuning for the kernel library of the 
current default (the one clang/llvm was compiled for) cpu in
pthread/basic device drivers. 


Optimization opportunities
--------------------------
* Even when using an in-order queue, schedule kernels
  in parallel in case their input buffers are not depending
  on the unfinished ones (should be legal per OpenCL 1.2 5.11).
* Compile for-loops without barriers like for-loops with
  barriers are, to produce better parallelizable code without
  fully unrolling everything. The difficulty is to detect when
  it's legal to do so (no diverging work-items when barrier is
  placed).
