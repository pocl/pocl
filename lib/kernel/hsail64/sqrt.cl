/* TODO:

   Clang does not recognize __builtin_sqrt* in CGBuiltin.cpp (around line 1285)
   to be a call to sqrt and cannot selectively convert it to the llvm.sqrt.*
   intrinsics with looser math flags. Therefore we have to call it as a libcall
   so it regonized it. For the double we still call the __builtin_sqrt() to
   disambiguate from the sqrt() to avoid infinite recursion. Probably the
   correct fix is to patch CGBuiltin.cpp to recognize also the call via
   __builtin_sqrt*. */

/* TODO HSAIL:
   related to previous TODO, neither __builtin_sqrt() nor any
  "high-level" intrinsics (llvm.sqrt, llvm.hsail.sqrt) works.

  I have implemented a workaround using bitcode in sqrt_default.ll, this however
  uses intrinsics with fixed behaviour (rounding mode etc.) so it's not a long
  term solution.
