/**
 * This file implements a customized memory allocator for OpenCL buffers.
 *
 * The allocator is designed to be fast and simple by tuning it to the
 * common OpenCL allocation patterns. It can be used from host to allocate
 * external device's memory or it can be used from within the device to
 * dynamically allocate local memory chunks. The interface is address space
 * agnostic; it treats memory addresses and regions of memory as integers.
 *
 * Certain assumptions of OpenCL allocation patterns are made to optimize and 
 * simplify the implementation:
 *
 * 1) The allocations are often quite large and the "lifetimes" of the
 * buffers are of similar length.
 *
 * This affects memory fragmentation patterns. When two or more buffers
 * with similar life times are allocated (typically all the buffer
 * arguments to an OpenCL kernel invocation) and freed we should try to
 * allocate sequential chunks for the buffers and in the free merge
 * the freed buffer with a succeeding and preceeding ones. This should
 * lead to large physical chunks allocated for each kernel's buffers
 * which are also deallocated back to large region chunks.
 *
 * 2) The total number of allocations is not large.
 *
 * Traversing through the list of chunk infos when searching for an
 * available freed chunk can be considered to be not very costly.
 *
 * 3a) There is no lack of (global) memory. 
 *
 * A wasteful but fast strategy can be used. Here the chunk is always
 * tried to be allocated to the end of the region to enforce "sequential
 * large chunks" for multiple buffers of a kernel.
 *
 * 3b) The memory is more tight (e.g. when allocating from local memory).
 *
 * A slower but less wasteful strategy should be used. In this version
 * the list of old chunks should be traversed first and reused in case
 * a large enough unallocated one is found. This version can be used 
 * also for the case where there's a single region (basically heap) that
 * grows towards the stack or the global data area of the memory.
