   *
   * The hostname should be in the following format:
   *
   *   vsock:[cid]

   * Where:
   *
   *   * `cid` is the context ID of the target virtual machine.
   *
   * This function will allocate memory to store the addrinfo structure and the
   * sockaddr_vm structure. The caller must free the addrinfo structure using
   * the host_freeaddrinfo() function instead of freeaddrinfo(3).
   *
   * Parameters:
   *
   *   * `hostname`: Pointer to a string containing the vsock hostname.
   *   * `port`: The port number of the vsock service.
   *
   * Returns:
   *
   *   * On success, returns a pointer to the addrinfo structure.
   *   * On failure, returns NULL.
